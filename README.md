# NewsScraper

This is a MongoDB powered web scraper.
Choose a section of the NY Times website to scrape, then click the **SCRAPE** button to display articles.
You can save an article and add your own personal notes to it on the _Saved Articles_ page

Built with Javascript, Node, Express, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Handlebars, Cheerio, AJAX, and JQuery,

2025 note- due to NY Times site changes, this solution no longer works.
Next steps:

- Switch to a headless browser like Puppeteer to load pages fully
- Wait for dynamic content to appear, then grab it via DOM selectors.
